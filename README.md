# HRocket Blogging for Geeks
HRocket aspires to be a static site generator that's a blogging Geek's best friend.

The name HRocket is a play on the venerable portable typewriter the Hermes Rocket.

## Design Notes
1. We should have a top level R folder where we organize our R code
1. We should have a bin folder with has bash scripts that wrap the top level R code
1. The user as part of the install instructions will be required to add bin to the path
1. Scripts that we should have in the bin folder:
    *. bin/hrmk -- this is the make file which will run the build process
    *. bin/hrclean -- this will delete any cache files
